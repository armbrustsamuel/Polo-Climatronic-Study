# Polo Climatronic

One year ago my car was diagnosed with a problem in the Climatronic Air, for this reason I decided to study about it and save documentation about that as Air conditioning Repair companies want about 7 thousand BRL to repair it. I notice that no one of them know how to run a simple system test in the device. So, it was good to me, maybe no one cares about that, but I decided to create a markdown file to save it for the future.

In the end, the issue was only the air conditioning compressor mirror and not the Climatronic device. Free points

If nothing here is interesting to you, at least take into account do not trust in the 'authorized' car repair companies. :) 

## Climatronic

### Auto test
Turn on the Climatronic unit, and then holding down the "ECON" button (this may be marked A/C, depending on the year of your car) and the Foot Vent or "Down-Arrow" button at the same time until both of the temperature displays show "iO", a common abbreviation in German for "in Ordnung" which means "OK" or "Operating Normally" (if you have a later Climatronic unit without temperature LCDs, this info will be displayed on the LCD of your stereo head unit).

If an error is encountered error codes will be displayed as a hexadecimal number in the left hand temperature display.
